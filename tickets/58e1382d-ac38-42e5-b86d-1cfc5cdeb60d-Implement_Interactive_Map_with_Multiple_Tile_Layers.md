# Ticket: Implement Interactive Map with Multiple Tile Layers

## Description
Implement an interactive map component that allows users to switch between multiple map tile layers (e.g., satellite, terrain, street view) for enhanced visualization. The map should be integrated into the main application and provide a user-friendly interface for toggling between available layers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The map displays at least three different tile layers (e.g., OpenStreetMap, Satellite, Terrain).
- [ ] Users can switch between tile layers using a visible control (e.g., dropdown, buttons, or layer control panel).
- [ ] The map is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- [ ] The default tile layer is OpenStreetMap.
- [ ] The map integrates with existing weather/location markers if present.
- [ ] All code follows best practices for React and component modularity.

## Notes
- Use a popular React map library (e.g., react-leaflet or similar).
- Ensure accessibility for the layer control.
- Add tests if the project uses a test framework.
